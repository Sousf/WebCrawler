      "(1)\n",
      "In an indictment for a riot, the facts constituting a riot, should be clearly set forth.\n",
      "(1) An indictment or complaint which states the year of the commission of the offense in figures only, without prefixing the letters “A. D.” is insufficient. Commonwealth v. McLoon, 5 Gray, (Massachusetts) Rep., 91. State v. Lane, 4 Iredell, 121.\n",
      "In State v. Hodgeden, 3 Vermont Rep., 481, the time of the commission of the offense was stated as follows: “A. D. 1830,” and was held to be sufficient. And similar was the case of State v. Gilbert, 13 Vermont Rep., 647.\n",
      "In Hall v. State, 3 Georgia Rep., 18, the offense was charged to have been committed “ In the year eighteen hundred and forty-six ; ” and the court said they would presume that to mean “ In the year of our Lord.\" The same was held by the Supreme Court of Indiana in Engleman v. State, 2 Carter, 91.\n",
      "Prom the authorities we think an indictment which alleges an offense to have been committed “in the year,\" &c., would be held good, although the words “ of our Lord,\" were omitted.\n",
      "In McFadden v. Fortier, 20 Ill. Rep., 515, the court referred to the second proposition decided in the case of Whitesides v. The People, and approved of the decision in that case.\n",

Two objections were made by defendant in the court below, to the plaintiff’s declaration : 1. That there was no profert made of the note declared on ; and 2. There was no consideration averred or stated. The court overruled these objections and gave judgment for the plaintiff, to reverse which, the defendant sued out a writ of error, and assigned the same objections as grounds of error.\n",

      "It is not required to make profert of writings not under seal.\n",
      "The statute makes it necessary for plaintiff to give oyer of all writings as the maker is bound to deny their execution under oath.\n",

There were two nihils returned, upon which, the court on motion gave judgment for McFerron. The point made was, whether the return of two nihils on a scire facias was equivalent to the actual service of process, when the defendant can be personally served.\n",

That the horses were not described with sufficient particularity; and 2. That the value of each horse should have been stated in the declaration. The demurrer was overruled, and an appeal taken to this court.\n",
